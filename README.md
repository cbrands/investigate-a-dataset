# investigate-a-dataset
This is the second project in the Data Analist Nanodegree program from Udacity.
I choose the No-show appointments dataset.

## Installation
I started with a linux virtual machine on Cloud 9. [https://c9.io/](https://c9.io/).
To install the needed software I used the following commands.
```
wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
rm Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
conda install numpy pandas jupyter
```
