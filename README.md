# investigate-a-dataset
This is the second project in the Data Analist Nanodegree program from Udacity.
I choose the No-show appointments dataset.

## Installation
Install the standard Anaconda distribution. Then type on the terminal.
```
conda upgrade conda
conda upgrade --all
```


## Run jupyter
to run jupyter use:
```
jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8080 --no-browser
```

point your browser to
* http://0.0.0.0:8080/tree

Now you can click on the file
project-2-investigate-a-dataset.ipynb to open the jupyter page. On the jupyter page click on 'Cell' and then 'Run All'
All the code will now run.
